1. made a rough schedule for the whole project and set up weekly meetings with TA.
2. went through the requirements of BigBucks project and plotted Use Case diagram to clarify the requirements
3. prepared the Backlog for the project and created a shared document for it. 
4. watched the "A Philosophy of Software Design" vedio and discussed about it

we did not code on the project in week1, so DORA metrics are not available.
